<p>As of 1300 hours, the Federation has declared war against the Klingon
  Empire. All Federation ships are to leave their exploration posts
  and rendezvous with the nearest starbase in their sector where they
  will receive further instruction.</p>
<p>Starfleet Out.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Captain Jean-Luc Picard sat at his desk. The klingons, he thought,
  finally. He was certain his Chief of Security wouldn't approve of
  Starfleet's anger towards the Klingons, but he made his choice to
  stay onboard the Enterprise. He had his chance.</p>

<p>Standing up, Picard exited his ready room. "Conn, lay in a course
  for starbase 447 and engage at warp 8."</p>

<p>The officer at conn did as ordered.</p>

<p>Riker looked at Picard. "Guess shoreleave is cancelled."</p>

<p>Picard nodded. "It never began Number One."</p>
